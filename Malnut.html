                    <article class="detail"> Malnutrition is a condition that arises when a person's body does not
                        receive enough nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required for normal growth, development, and
                        maintenance of healthy body tissues and functions. Malnutrition can either result from
                        undernutrition, where a person is not getting enough nutrients, or overnutrition, where a person
                        is consuming too many calories or nutrients but not in the right proportions.<br>
                        <br>Malnutrition can have a range of health consequences, including weakened immune systems,
                        stunted growth, impaired cognitive development, and an increased risk of disease and death. It
                        is a significant problem worldwide, affecting millions of people, particularly in low-income and
                        developing countries.

                        Treating underlying health conditions: Malnutrition can often be a symptom of an underlying
                        health condition. Treating these conditions, such as gastrointestinal diseases, can help to
                        improve nutrient absorption and reduce the risk of malnutrition.
